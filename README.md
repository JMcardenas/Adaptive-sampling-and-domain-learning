# Adaptive-sampling-and-domain-learning
This is a repository associated with the paper:

_An adaptive sampling and domain learning strategy for multivariate function approximation on unknown domains_ by Ben Adcock, Juan M. Cardenas, and Nick Dexter available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00144.

If you have questions or comments about the code, please contact [ben_adcock@sfu.ca](mailto:ben_adcock@sfu.ca?subject=[GitHub]%20Source%20Han%20Sans), [jcardena@sfu.ca](mailto:jcardena@sfu.ca?subject=[GitHub]%20Source%20Han%20Sans), or [nicholas_dexter@sfu.ca](mailto:nicholas_dexter@sfu.ca?subject=[GitHub]%20Source%20Han%20Sans).

# Code organization 
Files are organized into four main directories:

### src 
Contains the main Matlab files used to create figures in each chapter

Organized in chapters

### utils 
Contains various Matlab functions needed across main scripts

### data 
Contains .mat files generated by scripts in src

Organized in chapters

### Filenames

These generaically take the form 

fig_[number]\_[row]_[col]

where [number] is the figure numbers and [row] and [col] are the row number and column number is multi-panel figures.
